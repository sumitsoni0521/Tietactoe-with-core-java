# Tietactoe-with-core-java
Welcome to the coding world, here are two files I share first one is TTTGame.java & second is JGame.java both files show different methods to make a Tie-Tac-Toe Game.
In JGame.java we use (2D array)Arrays, Looping, if-else, class, Object, & Inheritance.
in everywhere class is not existing in reality object of class is exit.
And In the second TTTGame.java, we use the same concept.
